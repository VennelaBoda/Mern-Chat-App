# Mern-Chat-App
CHATWAVE (Real Time Chat App Using MERN Stack With JWT Authentication And  Socket.io Integration).
In today's digital age, real-time communication is essential, and building a chat application has become a quintessential project for web developers. This project is the chat application using MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, bolstered by JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication and Socket.io for seamless real-time communication.
The MERN stack offers a powerful combination of technologies for full-stack development, enabling the creation of robust and scalable web applications.
JWT authentication adds a layer of security to our chat application, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the features and functionalities.
Socket.io integration brings real-time communication capabilities to our chat application, enabling instant messaging between users.
